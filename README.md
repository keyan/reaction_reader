Prototype background program which can run on a blind or visually impaired user's computer to help with non-verbal communication during meetings.

Looks for QR codes which can be used to provide an audio description of meeting attendees non-verbal cues (e.g. smiling, nodding, shaking heads). Meant to run as a companion program along with software on the attendees' devices which overlays relevant QR codes on their camera output.

## Setup

```
brew install mpg123
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
